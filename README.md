## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd scxmcl-study-util

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server with Turbopack
npm run build     # Build for production with Turbopack
npm start         # Start production server
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` (or update your preferred dotenv file) and set the MongoDB connection details used by the API routes and seeding scripts:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGODB_DB=scxmcl-study-util
MONGODB_EXAMS_COLLECTION=exams
MONGODB_QUESTIONS_COLLECTION=questions

# For embeddings (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
QUESTIONS_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
# QUESTIONS_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=1536
MONGODB_QUESTION_EMBEDDINGS_COLLECTION=question_embeddings
```

When running against MongoDB Atlas, supply the SRV connection string (e.g. `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net`) and ensure your IP is allow-listed.

### Seeding Exam Data

Populate your MongoDB collection with the bundled JSON exams using:

```bash
pnpm seed:exams
```

The seeder loads JSON files from `data/exams/`, validates them with the shared Zod schema, and upserts documents keyed by `examId`. Ensure your environment variables point at the desired database/collection before running.

### Migrating Questions to Their Own Collection

To move embedded questions from each exam document into a dedicated `questions` collection while keeping backward compatibility:

```bash
pnpm migrate:questions
```

This script iterates all exams, upserts each embedded question into `MONGODB_QUESTIONS_COLLECTION` with a stable `id`, and marks the exam with `legacyQuestionsMigrated: true`. The API now prefers reading from the `questions` collection but falls back to the embedded array if none are present. Writes mirror to the legacy array to ease transition.

### Generating Question Embeddings

Embed each question (with its answer and optional explanation) into a vector for semantic search or retrieval workflows:

```bash
# Embed all questions to `question_embeddings`
pnpm embed:questions

# Target a single exam and recompute existing embeddings
pnpm embed:questions --exam sitecore-xmc --recompute

# Limit and batch-size (defaults: limit = all, batch = 16)
pnpm embed:questions --limit 100 --batch 32
```

Environment:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚Äì API key for embeddings
- `QUESTIONS_EMBEDDING_MODEL` ‚Äì defaults to `text-embedding-3-small`
- `QUESTIONS_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` ‚Äì optional; set to model dims (e.g., 1536)

MongoDB Atlas Vector Search (optional): create a vector index on `question_embeddings.embedding` with cosine similarity and the chosen dimensions. Name it via `MONGODB_QUESTION_EMBEDDINGS_VECTOR_INDEX`.

### Semantic Search (optional)

A development search endpoint is available to retrieve similar questions by semantic meaning:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/exams/sitecore-xmc/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "query": "experience edge publishing" , "topK": 5 }'
```

Requirements:
- Populate `question_embeddings` (see Embeddings above)
- Create a MongoDB Atlas Vector Search index on `question_embeddings.embedding`
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `MONGODB_QUESTION_EMBEDDINGS_VECTOR_INDEX`

### Importing Additional Questions

You can use the in-app importer at [`/import`](http://localhost:3000/import) to paste question JSON, preview validation, and submit it to a selected exam.

Alternatively, call the authenticated API (or run locally) to append multiple questions to an existing exam in one request:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/exams/sitecore-xmc/questions/import" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Sample prompt?",
        "options": {
          "A": "Option A",
          "B": "Option B",
          "C": "Option C",
          "D": "Option D"
        },
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Optional explanation.",
        "question_type": "single"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

The endpoint validates each question, generates stable `id` values, and returns the inserted records. If a generated `id` collides with an existing question, the API responds with HTTP 409 and a list of duplicate IDs so you can adjust the payload.

### Question Metrics Storage

Every time you run a quiz, the client records per-question metrics (seen, correct, incorrect) in `localStorage` under `scxmcl-question-metrics`. This avoids extra database load and keeps progress tracking lightweight and local. Resetting the browser storage clears these counters.

On the main configuration page you can use these metrics to spin up a ‚ÄúReview missed questions‚Äù session, which builds a quiz from just the questions with one or more incorrect attempts.

## Question Format

Questions are stored in JSON format and validated using Zod schemas. The application supports both single select and multiple select question types:

### Single Select Question
```json
{
  "question": "What architecture does Sitecore XM Cloud utilize?",
  "question_type": "single",
  "options": {
    "A": "Monolithic",
    "B": "Hybrid SaaS CMS with Headless Architecture",
    "C": "Traditional CMS",
    "D": "WYSIWYG"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "XM Cloud uses a hybrid SaaS CMS architecture...",
  "study": [
    {
      "chunkId": "xmc-arch-1",
      "url": "https://doc.sitecore.com/...",
      "excerpt": "XM Cloud is a hybrid SaaS CMS..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multiple Select Question
```json
{
  "question": "Which of the following are benefits of using Sitecore XM Cloud? (Select all that apply)",
  "question_type": "multiple",
  "options": {
    "A": "Automatic scaling and performance optimization",
    "B": "Reduced infrastructure management overhead",
    "C": "Built-in security updates and patches",
    "D": "Limited customization options"
  },
  "answer": ["A", "B", "C"],
  "explanation": "XM Cloud provides automatic scaling, reduces infrastructure management overhead, and includes built-in security updates. However, it actually offers extensive customization options, making option D incorrect.",
  "study": [
    {
      "chunkId": "xmc-benefits-1",
      "url": "https://doc.sitecore.com/...",
      "excerpt": "XM Cloud delivers automatic scaling, managed infrastructure..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Question Format Notes
- `question_type`: Optional field, defaults to "single" for backward compatibility
- `answer`: Single letter (A-D) for single select, array of letters for multiple select
- All other fields remain the same for both question types
