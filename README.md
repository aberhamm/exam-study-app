## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd scxmcl-study-util

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

### Data Flow (Exam)

- Home (server-rendered): server loads exam metadata and stats via `fetchExamById()` and `computeExamStats()` and passes them to the client UI. No full questions are fetched on load.
- Start Exam: navigation to `/exam/:examId` happens immediately. The exam route displays skeleton UI while it loads questions and prepares them per the saved settings. For targeted sessions (e.g., missed questions), Home pre-seeds `ExamState` and navigation is still immediate.
- Exam Page: server sets metadata (title) from `fetchExamById()`. The client resumes from a saved state when present (no fetch). If there‚Äôs no saved state, it fetches once and begins when ready, with skeletons shown until then.
- Quit ‚Üí Home: clearing `ExamState` prevents auto-resume; Home remains on the config view and only shows stats.

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev       # Start development server with Turbopack
npm run build     # Build for production with Turbopack
npm start         # Start production server
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
pnpm seed:exams   # Seed exam metadata + questions (no embedded arrays)
pnpm migrate:questions           # Migrate legacy embedded questions ‚Üí collection
pnpm sync:questions [flags]      # Reconcile new collection from legacy (preserves explanations)
pnpm remove:legacy-questions     # Remove embedded questions from exams
pnpm embed:questions [flags]     # Generate/refresh question embeddings
pnpm migrate:embeddings [flags]  # Move embeddings into their own collection
pnpm status:questions            # Summarize counts and latest update timestamps
```

See detailed script docs and use cases in docs/scripts.md.

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` (or update your preferred dotenv file) and set the MongoDB connection details used by the API routes and seeding scripts:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
MONGODB_DB=scxmcl-study-util
MONGODB_EXAMS_COLLECTION=exams
MONGODB_QUESTIONS_COLLECTION=questions

# For embeddings (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
QUESTIONS_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
# QUESTIONS_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=1536
MONGODB_QUESTION_EMBEDDINGS_COLLECTION=question_embeddings
```

When running against MongoDB Atlas, supply the SRV connection string (e.g. `mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net`) and ensure your IP is allow-listed.

### Seeding Exam Data

Populate your MongoDB with the bundled exams using:

```bash
pnpm seed:exams
```

This validates JSON files in `data/exams/` and upserts:
- Exam metadata into `MONGODB_EXAMS_COLLECTION` (no embedded questions)
- Questions into `MONGODB_QUESTIONS_COLLECTION` (stable ids). Existing explanation fields are preserved and not overwritten.

### Migrating and Removing Legacy Embedded Questions

If you previously embedded questions inside exam documents, migrate them and remove the legacy array:

```bash
# 1) Migrate embedded questions ‚Üí questions collection (insert/update)
pnpm migrate:questions

# 2) (Optional) Sync new collection from legacy without overwriting explanations
pnpm sync:questions [--exam <id>] [--dry-run] [--overwrite]

# 3) Remove embedded questions array from exams
pnpm remove:legacy-questions [--exam <id>] [--dry-run]
```

Notes:
- Explanations are never overwritten during migration/sync; they‚Äôre set only on insert.
- The API reads exclusively from the dedicated questions collection.

### Generating Question Embeddings

Embed each question (with its answer and optional explanation) into a vector for semantic search or retrieval workflows:

```bash
# Embed all questions to `question_embeddings`
pnpm embed:questions

# Target a single exam and recompute existing embeddings
pnpm embed:questions --exam sitecore-xmc --recompute

# Limit and batch-size (defaults: limit = all, batch = 16)
pnpm embed:questions --limit 100 --batch 32
```

Environment:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚Äì API key for embeddings
- `QUESTIONS_EMBEDDING_MODEL` ‚Äì defaults to `text-embedding-3-small`
- `QUESTIONS_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` ‚Äì optional; set to model dims (e.g., 1536)

MongoDB Atlas Vector Search (optional): create a vector index on `question_embeddings.embedding` with cosine similarity and the chosen dimensions. Name it via `MONGODB_QUESTION_EMBEDDINGS_VECTOR_INDEX`.

### Semantic Search (optional)

A development search endpoint is available to retrieve similar questions by semantic meaning:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/exams/sitecore-xmc/search" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "query": "experience edge publishing" , "topK": 5 }'
```

Requirements:
- Populate `question_embeddings` (see Embeddings above)
- Create a MongoDB Atlas Vector Search index on `question_embeddings.embedding`
- Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and (optionally) `QUESTIONS_EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS`
- Set `MONGODB_QUESTION_EMBEDDINGS_VECTOR_INDEX` to your index name if not using the default

### Dev Features Toggle

You can enable development tools and endpoints in non-development environments via feature flags.

- Server/API and middleware gating:
  - Set `ENABLE_DEV_FEATURES=1` to allow routes like `/import`, `/dev/*`, and APIs such as `/api/exams/:examId/search`, `/questions/import`, and `/questions/embed`.
- Client UI (build-time) toggle:
  - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_DEV_FEATURES=1` so client-rendered pages reflect that dev tools are enabled.

Notes:
- If neither flag is set, dev features are enabled only when `NODE_ENV === 'development'`.
- Production cache behavior and diagnostic logging remain tied to `NODE_ENV`.



### Importing Additional Questions

You can use the in-app importer at [`/import`](http://localhost:3000/import) to paste question JSON, preview validation, and submit it to a selected exam.

Alternatively, call the authenticated API (or run locally) to append multiple questions to an existing exam in one request:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/exams/sitecore-xmc/questions/import" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "questions": [
      {
        "question": "Sample prompt?",
        "options": {
          "A": "Option A",
          "B": "Option B",
          "C": "Option C",
          "D": "Option D"
        },
        "answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Optional explanation.",
        "question_type": "single"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

The endpoint validates each question, generates stable `id` values, and returns the inserted records. If a generated `id` collides with an existing question, the API responds with HTTP 409 and a list of duplicate IDs so you can adjust the payload.

### Question Metrics Storage

Every time you run a quiz, the client records per-question metrics (seen, correct, incorrect) in `localStorage` under `scxmcl-question-metrics`. This avoids extra database load and keeps progress tracking lightweight and local. Resetting the browser storage clears these counters.

On the main configuration page you can use these metrics to spin up a ‚ÄúReview missed questions‚Äù session, which builds a quiz from just the questions with one or more incorrect attempts.

## Question Format

Questions are stored in JSON format and validated using Zod schemas. The application supports both single select and multiple select question types:

### Single Select Question
```json
{
  "question": "What architecture does Sitecore XM Cloud utilize?",
  "question_type": "single",
  "options": {
    "A": "Monolithic",
    "B": "Hybrid SaaS CMS with Headless Architecture",
    "C": "Traditional CMS",
    "D": "WYSIWYG"
  },
  "answer": "B",
  "explanation": "XM Cloud uses a hybrid SaaS CMS architecture...",
  "study": [
    {
      "chunkId": "xmc-arch-1",
      "url": "https://doc.sitecore.com/...",
      "excerpt": "XM Cloud is a hybrid SaaS CMS..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Multiple Select Question
```json
{
  "question": "Which of the following are benefits of using Sitecore XM Cloud? (Select all that apply)",
  "question_type": "multiple",
  "options": {
    "A": "Automatic scaling and performance optimization",
    "B": "Reduced infrastructure management overhead",
    "C": "Built-in security updates and patches",
    "D": "Limited customization options"
  },
  "answer": ["A", "B", "C"],
  "explanation": "XM Cloud provides automatic scaling, reduces infrastructure management overhead, and includes built-in security updates. However, it actually offers extensive customization options, making option D incorrect.",
  "study": [
    {
      "chunkId": "xmc-benefits-1",
      "url": "https://doc.sitecore.com/...",
      "excerpt": "XM Cloud delivers automatic scaling, managed infrastructure..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Question Format Notes
- `question_type`: Optional field, defaults to "single" for backward compatibility
- `answer`: Single letter (A-D) for single select, array of letters for multiple select
- All other fields remain the same for both question types
