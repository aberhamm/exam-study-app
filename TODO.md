# TODO List

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Similarity Clustering System
- [x] **Implement clustering algorithm for grouping similar questions**
  - Connected components algorithm to group similar questions
  - Configurable similarity thresholds and cluster metrics
  - Support for splitting and merging clusters

- [x] **Add database schema for questionClusters collection**
  - New `questionClusters` collection with status tracking
  - Cluster metadata (similarity scores, timestamps, status)
  - Integration with existing MongoDB setup

- [x] **Add API endpoints for cluster operations**
  - `GET/POST /api/exams/[examId]/dedupe/clusters` - Generate and retrieve clusters
  - `GET/POST/DELETE /api/exams/[examId]/dedupe/clusters/[clusterId]` - Manage individual clusters
  - Support for cluster actions (approve, exclude, split, reset)

- [x] **Create new cluster view UI component for the dedupe page**
  - New "Similarity Groups" tab in dedupe interface
  - Expandable cluster cards showing all questions in groups
  - Visual status indicators and question previews

- [x] **Implement cluster management features (split, merge, exclude)**
  - Bulk actions: "Keep as Variants", "Mark as Duplicates"
  - Individual question exclusion from clusters
  - Cluster status management and audit trail

- [x] **Test the clustering functionality with real data**
  - Successfully generated 34 clusters from sitecore-xmc exam
  - Verified API endpoints and UI functionality
  - Confirmed vector similarity processing works correctly

## üìã Pending Tasks

  - ‚úÖ API endpoints for CRUD operations
  - ‚úÖ Vector search for semantic competency assignment
  - ‚úÖ Scripts for embedding and auto-assignment
  - ‚úÖ Management UI at /dev/competencies

- [ ] **Integrate competencies into question preparation**
  - Filter questions by competency in exam preparation
  - Ensure balanced competency distribution
  - Display competency assignments in question views

### UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] **Implement react-markdown to enable editing markdown better**
  - Improve markdown editing experience across the application
  - Better preview and editing capabilities

- [ ] **Create exam control panel for editing config/messages**
  - Centralized interface for exam configuration management

- [ ] **Break sources out of explanation and create relation between question and document chunk**
  - Remove embedded sources from explanation text
  - Create proper relation between questions and document chunks
  - Display sources in a prettier, more structured way using URLs from document chunks

## üéØ Future Enhancements

### Clustering Improvements
- [ ] **Advanced cluster splitting algorithms**
  - Implement automatic cluster splitting based on sub-similarity thresholds
  - Manual cluster editing and reorganization tools

- [ ] **Cluster quality metrics**
  - Add coherence scoring for cluster quality assessment
  - Cluster validation and recommendation system

### Exam Management
- [ ] **Exam constraint enforcement**
  - Prevent similar questions from appearing on same exam
  - Warning system for potential duplicates during exam generation
  - Automatic question substitution from different clusters

### Analytics & Reporting
- [ ] **Clustering analytics dashboard**
  - Cluster distribution statistics
  - Duplicate detection efficiency metrics
  - Historical clustering trends

## Notes

### Current System Status
- ‚úÖ Clustering system fully functional
- ‚úÖ UI provides comprehensive cluster management
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Cluster generation takes 60+ seconds (needs background processing)

### Key Features Delivered
- **Smart Question Grouping**: Automatically clusters similar questions using vector embeddings
- **Batch Decision Making**: Review entire groups instead of individual pairs
- **Flexible Management**: Exclude questions, approve variants, or mark duplicates
- **Visual Interface**: Expandable cards with full question content and actions
